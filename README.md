# OpenShift Native Hacking Tools

Some experimental tooling which has helped me achieve tight feedback loops and debugger capabilities while developing some of the more environmentally difficult control plane and other Kubernetes/OpenShift components (e.g. cloud provider code).

Prerequisites:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  * [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension
  * [Remote - Kubernetes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=okteto.remote-kubernetes]) extension
* An OpenShift cluster
